#### Fall Semester 2020
- 10 hours: Project planning
- 15 hours: Team meetings
- 10 hours: Research for statement finder
- 10 hours: Preparing deliverables
- Total: 45 hours
- Justification: Most of the work I did during the Fall was focused on planning the project with the team. This includes brainstorming ideas for the project and figuring out some initial designs. Additionally we spent some time preparing our deliverables for the class assignments. Finally, I spent some time towards the end of the semester working on my initial research into building a statement finder tool.

#### Spring Semester 2021
- 15 hours: Team meetings
- 10 hours: Research for statement finder
- 15 hours: Building initial statement finder
- 5 hours: Researching and implementing pronoun replacement
- 10 hours: Updating functionality of statement finder to final version
- 5 hours: Code cleanup and organization
- Total: 60 hours
- Justification: I completed the bulk of my actual project work during the Spring. We had 1-2 team meetings each week until the project was due for about an hour apiece to discuss and plan the project. I did most of my research at the start of the semester, then I developed an initial version of the statement finder tool. After that, I researched pronoun replacement and ultimately chose to implement an existing version (to save time). After that, I revisited the statement finder tool and ended up completely overhauling its functionality. Finally, I spent some time at the end of the project cleaning up and organizing my code.

#### Entire Year
- Total: 105 hours
