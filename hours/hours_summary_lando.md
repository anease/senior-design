# Summary of Hours and Justification

## Lando

#### Fall Semester 2020
- 10 hours: Project ideation and planning
- 15 hours: Team meetings
- 10 hours: Fact-checking methodology research
- 5 hours: Language processing research
- 5 hours: Web crawling and scraping research
- Total: 45 hours
- Justification: The Fall semester involved mostly ideation, planning, and preparation of our top-level design. I spent most of my time researching the process of fact-checks, becoming familiar with language parsing/processing capabilities, and seeing how web scrapers/crawlers work.

#### Spring Semester 2021
- 15 hours: Team meetings
- 10 hours: Web crawling and scraping research
- 10 hours: Building Wikipedia crawler
- 15 hours: Building Snopes crawler and attempting a Politifact crawler
- 5 hours: Refactoring working crawlers to fit project requirements
- 5 hours: Cleaning up written code
- Total: 60 hours
- Justification: During this semester I built the web crawler+scrapers that Deception Detective uses to query the web with a user's inputted statement. At the beginning of the project (the start of the Fall semester), I was not too familiar with the process of web crawling, so I had to take additional hours in the Spring semester to focus in on the subject and prepare for writing the code. It proved difficult to anticipate the structure and content of webpages, even under the same URL domain, so unfortunately my progress on the third crawler had to be stopped short. I finished out the semester by cleaning and refactoring the code to work with my team's tools and to meet the project's requirements.

#### Entire Year
- Total: 105 hours
