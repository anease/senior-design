- Justification: Development really began during the Spring semester. Weekly team meetings were essential in staying in sync with eachother's progress and honing in the scope of our project. I began by creating the Chrome extension and verified it's operation using test data. Then, I was able to start work on our back-end server that leveraged the logic created by the rest of the team. After this high level work was done, I spent the last portion of the semester fixing bugs and adjusting the front-end to the realities of our final application capabilities.
