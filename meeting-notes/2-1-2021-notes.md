# 02/01/2021 Meeting Notes


## Andrew
host web extension locally rather than on a server (for now at least)
web scraper pushed to lower priority

## Daniel
What I did:
- Expanded datasets somewhat (ongoing process)
- Split model testing code into separate file
- Started researching dependency grammar, uploaded initial notes

Goals for next week:
- Continue research on dependency grammar (maybe develop prototype)
- Continue expanding dataset
- Explore different classifiers for the statement-finder tool

- Put code into python server
- start indexing webpages
- work on web scraper

## Lando
for fact-checker, use short list of "worthy" websites ... start with wikipedia
write our own web page crawler?

## To-Dos
