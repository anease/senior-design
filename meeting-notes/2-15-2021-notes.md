## Lando
worked on wiki crawler. has input statement, uses wikipedia search URL to redirect, then scrapes through page and return text as an object
other pages to query: dictionary websites, snopes (API?)

todo: work on performance to not slow down web traffic; if no wiki page present, redirects to search results rather than a specific page
